"""
A simple plugin that fiddles with computer volume to reinforce quick reviewing.

Before using:
- Ensure that the "amixer" command works on your computer. If it doesn't, you're going to need to modify the code somehow. Don't ask me how. If someone knows how to code this so it doesn't depend on this, and puts the better version online, they are awesome and they should feel awesome.
- Change all lines marked with "CHANGEME" according to your preferences.
